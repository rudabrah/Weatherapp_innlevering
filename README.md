Weather app Qt Execise

This app is made as an excersise in QT.

It needs to work with the API from OpenWeather which you can read more about here: https://openweathermap.org/api

The app will take in the users wished city and api key. I might add someway to get the API key more easily in the future, but to keep it safe i make it a manual add.
One side will provide the current weather description
The other side will provide the forcast.

NOTE: The color choises are not critical, the point is just to have functionality at this point.

This is what it looks like when a request is sent - Note - only the current weather functions as of now:

Work in progress - I can reccomend this to learn QT.
